    There are three types of Web Development:
    Front-end Development: This is the interface of a website that the users see and interact with directly via the browser.
    Front-end developers use languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the outer design, and functionality that the end users can see in their web browsers.
    Back-end Development: This is a backend component of a website that contains the main logic running in the background and making your website work as expected.
    Back-end developers work on the server-side things of a website, and some of their common tasks include working on the storage part of large data,
      authentication authorization, and background communications using API.
    Full-stack Development: Full-stack developers work on both the front-end and back-end of a website. 
    It is the combination of the work done in frontend and backend development.
    There will be various responsibilities for you as a web developer. Some of the key tasks are:

    Creation of your basic Website
    Front-end Development
    Back-end Development
    Database Management
    Testing
