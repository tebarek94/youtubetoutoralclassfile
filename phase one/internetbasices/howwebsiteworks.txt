🌐 Step-by-Step: How a Website Works

User Enters a URL

You type something like www.google.com into your browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari, etc.).

Browser Sends a Request

Your browser sends a request through the internet to the website’s server.

It finds the server using the domain name system (DNS), which translates the name (like www.google.com ) into an IP address (like 192.168.1.1).

Server Receives the Request

The server is a computer that stores the website’s code, images, and data.

It checks what the user wants — maybe a homepage,a product list, or some information.

Server Processes and Responds

The server might use backend code (like Node.js, PHP, or Python) to get data from a database (like MySQL or MongoDB).

It then sends back a response — usually a mix of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

Browser Renders the Page

Your browser receives those files and builds the web page on your screen.

HTML defines the structure,
CSS styles it (colors, fonts, layout),
and JavaScript makes it interactive (buttons, animations, etc.).

You See the Website

The page appears on your screen — ready for you to scroll, click, and interact!
