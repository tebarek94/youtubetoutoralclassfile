       JavaScript Operators

*******************************

JavaScript operators are special symbols or keywords that perform operations
 on one or more values (operands) and return a result. 
 const resut= a+b
 They are fundamental for manipulating data and controlling program flow.



Here are the main types of JavaScript operators: 

    Arithmetic Operators: Perform mathematical calculations.
        + (Addition)
        - (Subtraction)
        * (Multiplication)
        / (Division)
        % (Remainder/Modulo)
        ** (Exponentiation)
        ++ (Increment)
        -- (Decrement)

        let a = 10 + 5;  // Addition
        let b = 10 - 5;  // Subtraction
        let c = 10 * 5;  // Multiplication
        let d = 10 / 5;  // Division
        let e = 10 % 3;  // Modulus (remainder)
        let f = 2 ** 3;  // Exponentiation (2 to the power of 3)
        let g = 5;
        g++;             // Increment (g becomes 6)
        let h = 5;
        h--;             // Decrement (h becomes 4)


    Assignment Operators: Assign values to variables.
        = (Simple assignment)
        let g=6
        += (Add and assign)
        -= (Subtract and assign)
        *= (Multiply and assign)
        /= (Divide and assign)
        %= (Remainder and assign)
        **= (Exponentiate and assign)

        += (Add and assign) 
        let a=9
        a+=4
        a=a+4
        a=9+4
       



    

    Comparison Operators: Compare two values and return a boolean (true or false).
        == (Equality - checks value only)
        let a=9;
        let b="11"
        a==b
        != (Inequality - checks value only)
        === (Strict equality - checks value and type)
        !== (Strict inequality - checks value and type)
        > (Greater than)
        < (Less than)
        >= (Greater than or equal to)
        <= (Less than or equal to)
        const x=4
        const y= 8
        const age>=18


        let result1 = (5 == 5);   // Equal to (value only) - true
            let result2 = (5 === '5'); // Strict equal to (value and type) - false
            let result3 = (5 != 10);  // Not equal to - true
            let result4 = (5 !== '5'); // Strict not equal to - true
            let result5 = (10 > 5);   // Greater than - true
            let result6 = (5 < 10);   // Less than - true
            let result7 = (10 >= 10); // Greater than or equal to - true
            let result8 = (5 <= 5);   // Less than or equal to - true


    Logical Operators: Combine or manipulate boolean values.
    && (Logical AND)
    a=true b = true 
     return true
    || (Logical OR)
    a= false and b = false return false
    ! (Logical NOT)
    a = true  false
    ?? (Nullish Coalescing - returns the right-hand operand if the left-hand operand is null or undefined)
