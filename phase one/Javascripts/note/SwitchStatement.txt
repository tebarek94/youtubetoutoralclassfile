switch statement
    The switch statement in JavaScript provides a way to control the flow of execution based on the value of an expression.
    It evaluates an expression and then compares its value against a series of case clauses.
    When a match is found, the code block associated with that case is executed.


Syntax
  
    switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        // Code to execute if expression === value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // Code to execute if expression === value2
        break;
    // ... more cases
    default:
        // Code to execute if no case matches
    }

 Explanation:
        switch (expression): The switch keyword is followed by the expression in
        parentheses whose value will be evaluated.

        case valueN:: Each case clause specifies a value to compare against the expression.

        If the expression strictly equals (===) the valueN, the code block following that case is executed.
        
        break;: The break statement is crucial. It terminates the switch statement, preventing "fall-through" to subsequent case clauses. Without break, execution would continue into the next case even if a match was already found.

        default:: The default clause is optional. If no case matches the expression's value, the code block within the default clause is executed. By convention, the default clause is usually placed at the end, although it can appear anywhere.



Example:

    let dayOfWeek = "Tuesday";
    switch (dayOfWeek) {
    case "Monday":
        console.log("Start of the work week.");
        break;
    case "Tuesday":
    case "Wednesday":
        console.log("Mid-week grind.");
        break;
    case "Thursday":
        console.log("Almost Friday!");
        break;
    case "Friday":
        console.log("Weekend is here!");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("It's the weekend!");
    }
