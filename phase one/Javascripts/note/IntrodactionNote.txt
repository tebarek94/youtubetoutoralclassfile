3. How JavaScript Works with HTML and CSS


Think of a website like a human body:

HTML → the skeleton (structure)

CSS → the skin/clothes (design)

JavaScript → the brain (behavior/interactivity)

🧱 Example:
When a user clicks a button (HTML),
CSS makes it look nice, and
JavaScript tells the browser what to do (e.g., show a message).

📄 Simple Diagram:

HTML → Content
CSS  → Style
JS   → Action
