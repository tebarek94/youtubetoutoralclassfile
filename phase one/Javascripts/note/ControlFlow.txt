          Control Flow in JavaScript

***********************************************

Control flow 
    in JavaScript dictates the order in which statements are executed within a program. By default, JavaScript code runs sequentially from top to bottom, line by line. However, control flow mechanisms allow for the alteration of this default order, enabling programs to make decisions and repeat actions based on specific conditions. 
    Key control flow constructs in JavaScript include: 
    Conditional Statements: These allow the execution of different code blocks based on whether a condition evaluates to true or false.
    if statement: Executes a block of code only if the specified condition is true.

for example
  
        let age = 20;
        if (age >= 18) {
          console.log("You are an adult.");
        }


if...else statement: 

    Provides two paths of execution: one if the condition is true, and another if it's false
    let age = 16;
            if (age >= 18) {
            console.log("You can vote.");
            } else {
            console.log("You are too young to vote.");
            }

else if statement: 
Used to test multiple conditions in sequence

let score = 85;
        if (score >= 90) {
          console.log("Grade A");
        } else if (score >= 80) {
          console.log("Grade B");
        } else {
          console.log("Grade C");
        }

switch statement:

   Provides a way to execute different code blocks based on the value of an expression.
   let day = "Monday";
        switch (day) {
          case "Monday":
            console.log("Start of the week.");
            break;
          case "Friday":
            console.log("End of the work week.");
            break;
          default:
            console.log("Regular day.");
        }

Ternary Operator (? :):
    A concise way to write simple if...else statements.
    let isAdult = (age >= 18) ? true : false;
        console.log(isAdult);
