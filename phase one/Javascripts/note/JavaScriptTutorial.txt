These core components allow for the creation of dynamic and interactive web content, as well as server-side applications.
Key Basic Concepts:
Variables: Used to store data. Declared using keywords like let or const.
JavaScript Programs
A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.

These programming instructions are called statements.

Most JavaScript programs contain many statements.

The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written.

   
 Data Types: Define the type of data a variable can hold, such as numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, and objects.
  let message = "Hello, World!";
    const PI = 3.14159;



JavaScript Syntax
Syntax are the rules how programs must be constructed:
// How to Declare variables:
let x = 5;
let x;
x=9;

let y = 6;

// How to Compute values:
let z = x + y;

// I am a Comment. I do Nothing
JavaScript Values
The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:

Literals (Fixed values)
Variables (Variable values)
JavaScript Literals
The most important syntax rules for literals (fixed values) are:

Numbers are written with or without decimals:

Example
Strings are text, written within double or single quotes:
Example
"John Doe"

'John Doe'
JavaScript Keywords
JavaScript keywords are used to defines actions to be performed.

The let and const keywords create variables:
Note
JavaScript keywords are case-sensitive.

JavaScript does not interpret LET or Let as the keyword let.
JavaScript Variables
Variables are containers for storing data values.

Variables must be identified with unique names.
Example
// Define x as a variable
let x;

// Assign the value 6 to x
x = 6;
JavaScript Identifiers
An identifier is the name you give to a variable.

Rules for identifiers:

Must start with a letter, _, or $
Can contain digits after the first character
Cannot be a reserved keyword (let, const, if, etc.)
Are case-sensitive
JavaScript Operators
JavaScript assignment operators (=) assign values to variables:

Example
let x = 5;
let y = 6;
let sum = x + y;

JavaScript uses arithmetic operators ( + - * / ) to compute values:
JavaScript Expressions
An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value.

Examples
(5 + 6) * 10 evaluates to 110:

(5 + 6) * 10
JavaScript is Case Sensitive
JavaScript identifiers are case sensitive.

The variables lastName and lastname, are different variables:

Example
let lastName = "Doe";
let lastname = "Peterson";
JavaScript and Camel Case
Historically, programmers have used different ways of joining multiple words into one variable name:

Hyphens:

first-name, last-name, master-card, inter-city.

Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions.

Underscore:

first_name, last_name, master_card, inter_city.

Upper Camel Case (Pascal Case):

FirstName, LastName, MasterCard, InterCity.


Lower Camel Case:

firstName, lastName, masterCard, interCity.

JavaScript programmers tend to use lower camel case.
What is a correct syntax for assigning a value to a variable?


x : 5
x = 5
x == 5
x -> 5
