   
    In JavaScript, objects 
        are fundamental data structures used to store collections of related data and functionality.
        They are essentially containers for properties and methods.
        
        Properties are key-value pairs that describe the characteristics or data associated with an object.

        The key (or property name) is typically a string, and the value can be of any data type, 
        including primitives (strings, numbers, booleans), other objects, or functions.

        Methods are functions stored as properties within an object. 

        They define the actions or behaviors that an object can perform.

        When a function is part of an object, it's referred to as a method.


Here's a basic example of an object:
        const person = {
        firstName: "John",
        lastName: "Doe",
        age: 30,
        greet: function() {
            console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}.`);
        }
        };

In this example:
    person is an object.
    firstName, lastName, and age are properties with string and number values.
    greet is a method, which is a function that logs a greeting to the console. The this keyword inside the greet method refers to the person object itself.

Key characteristics of JavaScript objects:

    Unordered collections: While you can define properties in a specific order, 
    JavaScript objects do not guarantee the order of their properties when iterated over
    (though modern engines often preserve insertion order for non-integer keys).

    Dynamic: Properties and methods can be added, modified, or deleted from an object at runtime.
    Reference type: When you assign an object to a new variable, 
    you are copying a reference to the original object, not a new copy of the object itself.
    Foundation of many other constructs: Arrays, functions, 
    and even null are technically objects in JavaScript.

    Objects are a cornerstone of JavaScript development,
    enabling the creation of structured data and modular, object-oriented programming approaches.
