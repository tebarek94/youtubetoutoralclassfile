# Phase One — HTML / CSS / JavaScript Examples

This repository is a personal collection of small HTML, CSS and JavaScript examples and notes for learning and demonstration.

## What you'll find here

- `CSS/` — example pages demonstrating box-shadow, colors, selectors, and other CSS features.
- `HTML/` — input examples, lists, tables, and basic HTML demos.
- `Javascripts/` — small scripts, examples of functions, loops, operators and notes.
- `internetbasices/` — notes and beginner-level explanations about how websites work.

The files are mostly standalone HTML pages that you can open directly in a browser.

## How to view the site

1. Easiest: open any `.html` file in your browser (double-click or right-click → Open).
2. Recommended for browsing multiple pages: serve the folder locally and open via HTTP.

From PowerShell, run:

```powershell
# from the project root (where this README.md lives)
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Or, open the folder in VS Code and use the Live Server extension to launch a local server.
